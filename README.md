# Voltage-Stabilizer-with-Series-Adjustment-Element
This project involved designing a voltage stabilizer with a series regulator element 
aimed at maintaining a constant output voltage, regardless of input voltages 
within a specified range, using a series regulator element. Its functionality relied 
on calculating and dimensioning circuit parameters, highlighted through a series 
of simulations. OrCAD was used for designing the electrical schematic, while PCB 
Editor was utilized for layout implementation.
